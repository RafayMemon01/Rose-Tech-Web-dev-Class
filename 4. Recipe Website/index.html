          Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's typically
          reserved for special occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such
          as Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth
          it. For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use.
